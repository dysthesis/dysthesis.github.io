**Note.** Unfinished draft, mainly just a braindump.

tl;dr when adding some idea, treat it as a _hypothesis_. crucially, define for
it some falsification criteria, in order to

- draw it into attention in your mind, and
- make it more obvious if some other idea in your notes contradicts another.

this maps to the notion of proving a system correct by proving that it is

- sound, which means everything provable is true, and
- completeness, which means that everything that is true has a proof.

it's unrealistic to expect a perfectly sound and complete note; you're not god.
falsification, however, proves some _unsoundness_ in the system, and is therefore
key to address.

# The Sociologist and the Silkworm

draw a comparison between luhmann's zettelkasten, the spirit of which is to have
small notes _co-operate_ in order to build bigger ideas, and the [gu/jinchan poison],
the premise of which being that sealing a bunch of posionous insects causes them
to devour each other and leaves only one to survive, the toxins of the others
concentrated on it. the idea is that a good system requires both _collaboration_
and _competition_.
