The early winter of Lüneburg in 1927 was the birth of a prolific German
sociologist. A sibling of the blinding snow, the prolific mind and hands of
Niklas Luhmann was anything but cold. His career would be the progenitor of 70
books and 400 articles, spanning across a wide spectrum of disciplines: law,
politics, economy, art, and religion to name a few.[^1] In this quiet solace,
Luhmann serenely tended a republic of a thousand citizens, silkworms of solitary
thoughts. Together, they spun the endless silk of thought--the soltitude of
thought producing multitudes.

Vastly removed from this in both time and space, the 14th century BCE Shang
dynasty--and separately, the 7th century CE Tang dynasty--brought with it the
蠱 (_gu_)--or equivalently, 金蠶 (_jin can_; literally, the _gold silkworm or
caterpilllar_) in the Tang dynasty--the practice of confining a multitude of
poisonous insects in a jar. These insects would be forced to devour each other
to survive, and it is said that the final survivour will possess the most
powerful poison. [^2]

The busy silkworms of Luhmann's republic were diligent; none can argue to the
contrary. Yet it has known only peace, and a nation at peace is lulled into
complacency. They grew warm and wise, yet have never tasted blood.
