The early winter of Lüneburg in 1927 was the birth of a prolific German
sociologist. A sibling of the blinding snow, the prolific mind and hands of
Niklas Luhmann was anything but cold. His career would be the progenitor of 70
books and 400 articles, spanning across a wide spectrum of disciplines: law,
politics, economy, art, and religion to name a few.[^1] In this quiet solace,
Luhmann serenely tended a republic of a thousand citizens, silkworms of solitary
thoughts. Together, they spun the endless silk of thought--the soltitude of
thought producing multitudes.

Vastly removed from this in both time and space, the 14th century BCE Shang
dynasty--and separately, the 7th century CE Tang dynasty--brought with it the
蠱 (_gu_)--or equivalently, 金蠶 (_jin can_; literally, the _gold silkworm or
caterpilllar_) in the Tang dynasty--the practice of confining a multitude of
poisonous insects in a jar. These insects would be forced to devour each other
to survive, and it is said that the final survivour will possess the most
powerful poison. [^2]

The busy silkworms of Luhmann's republic were diligent; none can argue to the
contrary. Yet it has known only peace, and a nation at peace is lulled into
complacency. They grew warm and wise, yet have never tasted blood.

Niklas Luhmann attributed a non-trivial amount of his productive output to the
continued tending of his intellectual garden--his _Zettelkasten_. In essence, it
was a collection of index cards, each inscribed with an identifier and a
_singular_ thought. Each card may refer to others by their respective
identifiers, allowing them to build on each other.

The central thesis of this approach is _emergence_[^3]--that the Zettelkasten is
greater than the sum of its index cards. A fundamental way in which this occurs
is by exposing an otherwise non-obvious connection between multiple, seemingly
irrelevant ideas or even fields of study. That is, these ideas **collaborates**
with each other to construct larger ideas.[^4]

One may notice a subtle chasm presented by this notion, however: that while
these ideas builds upon each others' strengths, none inherently notices each of
their weaknesses. The peaceful silkworms have built their prosperity upon peace,
yet they know not how to defend it when the blaring horns of war shouts.

[^3]: Emergence is an idea which, much like Luhmann himself, lies at the complex
intersection of multiple disciplines. At its core, it is the observation that a
composite entity may exhibit behaviour that is not present in any of its
individual constituent components, and simultaneously, the conjecture that it is
a sort of fundamental law of the universe.

[^4]: As an aside, one may notice the analogy with [dynamic
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming), except in that
a Zettelkasten is bottom-up in nature, in contrast to the top-down regime of
dynamic programming.
